# Migratory â€“ Dependently-Typed Database Migrations in Haskell

That, pretty much.

It covers the exact use case that I have for it at the moment, it is not intended for general consumption at the moment. However, the core functionality is general enough that it will most likely be useful to someone, if they correct the minor limitations that it has at the moment (e.g. being limited to exactly the data types and constraints that I need for the application that I am developing Migratory for use in).

If the above and the version number below 1.0 didn't make it clear enough, this is VERY, VERY pre-alpha software, effectively forming a proof-of-concept.
